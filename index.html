    <h1>Lack of Computers in Schools and Organizations</h1>
    <p>Research Based on Survey Results in Kazakhstan</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The topic of the research is the lack of computers in schools and organizations and how it affects different sectors. A Google Forms survey was conducted among 50 participants including students, teachers, school administrators, civil servants, and IT employees.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Respondent Demographics</h2>
    <p>72% were students, 8% teachers, 2% administrators, 6% civil servants, and 12% IT professionals or private entrepreneurs.</p>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
    <p>76% of respondents said computers are sufficient, but 24% said they lack them, meaning 1 in 4 people experiences difficulties.</p>
    <img src="chart2.png" alt="Figure 2: Sufficient computers for daily needs" />

    <p>On average, 54% use one computer individually, while others share: 2–3 people (14%), 4–6 people (16%), and 6+ people (16%).</p>
    <img src="chart3.png" alt="Figure 3: Number of people using 1 computer" />

    <p>Only 22% never have trouble accessing a computer. Most (78%) face this problem sometimes or often.</p>

  <h2>Causes and Consequences</h2>
  <p>
    The lack of computers in schools and organizations in Kazakhstan is caused by a combination of economic, administrative, and structural problems. According to the survey results, the most frequently mentioned issue was the lack of budget or insufficient government funding. About 52% of respondents pointed out that digitalization and technology access are still not prioritized at the national level, and many educational institutions struggle to receive enough financial support to upgrade their computer labs or replace outdated equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another 10% of respondents believed that corruption plays a major role in this problem. In some cases, funds that were officially allocated to purchase technology never reached the institutions due to corruption at various levels of the procurement process. This creates mistrust among the population and reduces the effectiveness of any governmental digital reform programs.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition, 16% of the people surveyed mentioned that the issue lies in the complex logistics and supply chain management for computer equipment. Some schools and offices are located in remote areas where it is difficult to transport modern technology. Also, the lack of reliable suppliers and dependence on outdated contracts leads to delays and inefficient use of resources.
  </p>
  <p>
    These causes have direct and measurable consequences. Students often do not have access to digital resources during lessons, which limits their ability to develop technical skills that are crucial in the 21st century. Teachers shared that they are forced to change lesson plans or rely on students’ personal phones, which distract them and reduce academic performance. In professional environments, a shortage of computers slows down work processes, decreases overall productivity, and limits digital communication and documentation. As a result, both education and administrative sectors suffer from low efficiency and poor digital integration.
  </p>

  <h2>Proposed Solutions</h2>
  <p>
    The survey respondents also suggested several solutions that could help alleviate the issue of computer shortages. One commonly suggested approach (26%) was to redistribute unused or outdated computers from government agencies or private companies to schools and small organizations. While these devices may not be suitable for high-end tasks, they can still support basic educational or administrative work. A nationwide recycling and redistribution program could significantly reduce the technological gap between institutions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another key solution, supported by 28% of respondents, is to increase targeted government funding for technology in education and public services. This includes not only purchasing computers but also investing in internet infrastructure, IT support, and training for teachers and staff. Long-term, strategic planning is essential to ensure that technology becomes an integral part of every school and office in Kazakhstan.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition, 6% emphasized the importance of implementing stronger anti-corruption measures. Respondents recommended introducing public reporting systems, strict vetting procedures, and third-party audits for any purchases made with public funds. By ensuring that financial resources are used correctly, the country could significantly improve the availability and quality of computers in public institutions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Respondents also mentioned that public-private partnerships could be encouraged to bridge the technology gap. Companies could be motivated to support educational institutions through donations, sponsorships, or volunteer IT support programs. Together with strong policy, this could create a sustainable ecosystem of digital inclusion.
  </p>

  <h2>Discussion</h2>
  <p>
    The findings of this research strongly confirm the initial hypothesis: that the lack of computers has a negative impact on education and organizational efficiency in Kazakhstan. The data shows that both students and teachers are directly affected by this issue. For students, it results in missed deadlines, lack of access to research tools, and reduced digital skills development. For teachers, it limits their ability to use modern teaching methods and interactive learning platforms.
  </p>
  <p>
    Moreover, the inability to access technology affects students' motivation and engagement. When they are forced to rely on mobile phones or wait in line to use a shared computer, the learning process becomes fragmented and stressful. This has long-term consequences on students’ readiness for higher education and future employment, especially in fields requiring digital literacy.
  </p>
  <p>
    From an administrative perspective, civil servants and private entrepreneurs reported that work productivity decreases significantly when they do not have access to reliable technology. Filing reports, managing data, and communicating with colleagues becomes inefficient and time-consuming.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the limitations of this research was the online nature of the survey. While it provided a quick way to gather data, it also limited the depth and clarity of some answers. Respondents often gave short replies due to the lack of face-to-face interaction or understanding of the importance of each question. In the future, it would be helpful to conduct in-person interviews or focus groups for deeper insights.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    In conclusion, this study highlights a critical issue affecting education and organizational efficiency in Kazakhstan: the widespread lack of access to computers. Based on both the survey results and secondary sources, the main causes of this problem are lack of funding, corruption in resource allocation, and ineffective supply chains.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, the situation is not without hope. Respondents provided realistic and practical solutions that can be implemented by the government, private sector, and civil society. Recycling unused computers, increasing targeted funding, implementing anti-corruption strategies, and promoting public-private partnerships can collectively address this problem.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ultimately, solving this issue is not just about buying more equipment. It’s about ensuring that every student, teacher, and employee in Kazakhstan has access to the tools they need to learn, grow, and work effectively in a digital age. By investing in technology and supporting transparency, the country can close the digital gap and build a future where opportunities are equally accessible to all.
