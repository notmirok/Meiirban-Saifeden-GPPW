    <h1>Lack of Computers in Schools and Organizations</h1>
    <p>Research Based on Survey Results in Kazakhstan</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The topic of the research is the lack of computers in schools and organizations and how it affects different sectors. A Google Forms survey was conducted among 50 participants including students, teachers, school administrators, civil servants, and IT employees.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Respondent Demographics</h2>
    <p>72% were students, 8% teachers, 2% administrators, 6% civil servants, and 12% IT professionals or private entrepreneurs.</p>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
    <p>76% of respondents said computers are sufficient, but 24% said they lack them, meaning 1 in 4 people experiences difficulties.</p>
    <img src="chart2.png" alt="Figure 2: Sufficient computers for daily needs" />

    <p>On average, 54% use one computer individually, while others share: 2–3 people (14%), 4–6 people (16%), and 6+ people (16%).</p>
    <img src="chart3.png" alt="Figure 3: Number of people using 1 computer" />

    <p>Only 22% never have trouble accessing a computer. Most (78%) face this problem sometimes or often.</p>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Causes and Consequences</h2>
    <p>Major causes identified: lack of funding (52%), corruption (10%), and complex supply chains (16%).</p>
    <p>Teachers noted students are distracted by using phones, while students couldn't finish projects on time due to limited computer access.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Proposed Solutions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Sell old or budget computers (26%)</li>
      <li>Increase targeted funding for digital equipment (28%)</li>
      <li>Fight corruption by enforcing stricter control (6%)</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p>The lack of computers limits digital literacy and access to modern educational resources. The survey confirms the hypothesis that technology shortages impact learning effectiveness and productivity.</p>
    <p>The main challenge during the project was collecting responses in a short time frame. Online-only data collection also reduced the detail of some answers.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This research confirms that the lack of computers is a significant problem in Kazakhstan. Both survey and online sources identify funding and corruption as major issues. It is essential to address them through better policies, stable suppliers, and investments in digital infrastructure.</p>
