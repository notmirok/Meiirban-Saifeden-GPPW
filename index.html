    <h1>Lack of Computers in Schools and Organizations</h1>
    <p>Research Based on Survey Results in Kazakhstan</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The topic of the research is the lack of computers in schools and organizations and how it affects different sectors. A Google Forms survey was conducted among 50 participants including students, teachers, school administrators, civil servants, and IT employees.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Respondent Demographics</h2>
    <p>72% were students, 8% teachers, 2% administrators, 6% civil servants, and 12% IT professionals or private entrepreneurs.</p>
    <div class="chart-placeholder">[Figure 1: Roles of responders]</div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
    <p>76% of respondents said computers are sufficient, but 24% said they lack them, meaning 1 in 4 people experiences difficulties.</p>
    <div class="chart-placeholder">[Figure 2: Sufficient computers for daily needs]</div>

    <p>On average, 54% use one computer individually, while others share: 2–3 people (14%), 4–6 people (16%), and 6+ people (16%).</p>
    <div class="chart-placeholder">[Figure 3: Number of people using 1 computer]</div>

    <p>Only 22% never have trouble accessing a computer. Most (78%) face this problem sometimes or often.</p>
    <div class="chart-placeholder">[Figure 4: Frequency of access problems]</div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Causes and Consequences</h2>
    <p>Major causes identified: lack of funding (52%), corruption (10%), and complex supply chains (16%).</p>
    <p>Teachers noted students are distracted by using phones, while students couldn't finish projects on time.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Proposed Solutions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Sell old/budget computers (26%)</li>
      <li>Increase targeted funding (28%)</li>
      <li>Fight corruption through stricter regulation (6%)</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p>The lack of computers limits digital literacy and access to modern educational resources. The survey supports the hypothesis that technology shortages impact learning effectiveness.</p>
    <p>The biggest challenge was collecting survey responses due to tight deadlines and online format limitations.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The problem of lack of computers is real and confirmed by both survey and secondary sources. Urgent funding and affordable suppliers are needed for long-term improvement.</p>
